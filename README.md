# SteamGame_Scrape_Analysis

# Online-Game Review Analysis
This project was undertaken as a part of the IT 362 Data Science Principles course at King Saud University, College of Computer and Information Sciences. The project aimed to perform an analysis of online game reviews scraped from Steam, one of the largest online gaming platforms, in order to identify patterns, trends, and preferences among gamers.

### Challenges
The project encountered challenges in data collection due to the absence of clear API documentation from the Steam website. This is why we applied web scraping using HTML.

### Data Scraping and Cleaning
Web scraping was performed by inspecting HTML documents and extracting specific class and div labels. The collected attributes were cleaned, involving steps such as attribute selection, splitting, and casting to ensure the data's quality.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
The team performed univariate and multivariate analysis, leveraging both graphical and non-graphical methods. The statistical descriptions and plotted graphs revealed valuable insights into categorical and numerical data, facilitating a better understanding of gaming patterns and user interactions within the dataset.

### Questions and Answers
The project formulated and answered five key questions regarding online game reviews, ranging from the impact of review helpfulness on game recommendations to the correlation between hours played and recommendations.
